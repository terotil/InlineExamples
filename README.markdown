InlineExamples
==============

Sample code, examples, can serve as both documentation and tests.  (In
RSpec tradition tests are actually called "examples".)  Separating
tests from code helps you keep your code shorter and cleaner.  But it
may also keep you from cleaning up your tests.  They become the "scary
basement".

What if the tests/examples would be mixed in your code?  Would you
write better tests if you'd know more people would look at them?
Would you write better examples (of the intended and common usage of
your lib) if your examples would actually run with tests?

InlineExamples is in pre development phase, which reads **THIS IS AN
UNUSABLE HACK**.  Looking forward to change that though.
