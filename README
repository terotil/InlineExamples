= InlineExamples

Tired of updating your code examples?  Sample code, examples, can
serve you as both documentation and tests.(*  And you'll have the added
bonus of your developer documentation not falling out of sync with
your code. (provided you actually run the tests)

*) In some traditions unit tests are actually called "examples". How
   convinient!

InlineExamples is in pre development phase, which reads

	THIS IS AN UNUSABLE HACK

Looking forward to change that though.
